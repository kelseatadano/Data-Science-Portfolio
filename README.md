# Data Projects Portfolio

## About Me 

Hi and welcome to my data science portfolio! 

I am Kelsea, a student in her final year of undergrad, a beach volleyball enthusiast, newbie weight lifter, and einspanner latte connoisseur. I enjoy being outdoors, whether that be the mountains (i love to ski) or the beach. 

In the last quarter of my junior year of undergrad, I decided to start studying data science with a goal of becoming a data scientist. Since then, I have completed courses in machine learning and data science fundamentals, creating a foundation for me to start creating projects of my own. I am excited to learn more about data science throughout this process, and more excited to apply my knowledge toward meaningful and interesting projects. Thank you for taking the time to look over my portfolio, I really appreciate it!
